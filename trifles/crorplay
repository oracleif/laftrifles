#	Cover script to repeatedly run cror in growth mode with the
#	multicolor option.  The "forced" options are:
#	- Loop mode with a loop size of 500 (-l and -s500)
#	- Growth mode (-g), so instead of clearing the screen and
#	recentering the cursor after each loop, the cursor is just left in
#	place to resume drawing when the user hits Enter.
#	- Color switch minimum of 50 steps (-C 50)
#	- Clear screen on cror exit (-c)
#
#	While the c, l, and g switches are always on, the values for the -C
#	and -s options can be replaced with values from the command line if
#	specified.  All other options are passed through to cror (e.g., -a is
#	recommended for improved performance on ANSI terminals).
#


#
# Process command line options.  Preset values for -s and -C, but discard
# the presets if the option appears on the command line.

# Invoke cror inside this loop with the specified options.  The process
# flow is:
# 1. Present the user with a "Next: " prompt
# 2. User presses Enter to continue or ^C to exit the program.
# 3. If continuing, cror is called with requested options and commences
# drawing its pattern.  Drawing will change colors in sequence at random
# intervals, but only after at least CSIZE characters have been output in
# the current color.  The pattern will grow by PSIZE characters at a time,
# then pause.
# 4. If the user presses Enter, the pattern will grow by another PSIZE
# characters.
# 5. If the user presses ^C to exit cror, cror will clear the screen on
# exit and we return to step #1.
