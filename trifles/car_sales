##Write a Car Salesman program where the user enters the base price of a
##car. The program should add on a bunch of extra fees such as tax,
##license, dealer prep, and destination charge. Make tax and license a
##percent of the base price. The other fees should be set values.
##Display the actual price of the car once all the extras are applied.
