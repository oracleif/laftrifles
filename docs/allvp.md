# allvp: A Shell Script for Video Poker

## Motivation

*allvp* was developed as a demonstration script (originally in *ksh*, now in
*bash*) to employ various shell constructs and *nix utilities in pursuit of a
somewhat silly goal - playing video poker on a character display.  My original
thought was that this would provide an interesting excuse for exploring some
advanced scripting techniques.

## Adding wild card support

## Adding card images

## Adding color to card images
