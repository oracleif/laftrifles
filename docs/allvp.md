# allvp: A Shell Script for Video Poker

## Motivation

*allvp* was developed as a demonstration script (originally in *ksh*, now in

somewhat silly goal - playing video poker on a character display.  My original
thought was that this would provide an interesting excuse for exploring some
advanced scripting techniques.
