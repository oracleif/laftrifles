# cror: A Shell Script for Pretty Patterns

## Motivation

I've long been fascinated with the visual effects that can be produced by
simple random walks, writing small programs to bring these to my computer
displays.  Initially, this took the form of "worm" programs, where one or more
strings of light blocks or characters would crawl randomly around the screen.
I eventually noticed the rorschach screensaver for X and realized that this
was in effect the product of a symmetrical random walk, and began trying to
re-create the effect on lower resolution block or character-based displays.
My initial efforts used the simple block graphics available on the display of
my CP/M-based Kaypro 1 driven by a compiled program written in S-Basic, and it
quickly became clear that producing the equivalent of a Rorschach ink blot on
screen was pretty easy even with such limited hardware.

At around the same time the shell scripts I was preparing in my work life were
getting more sophisticated, and I was becoming more comfortable tackling more
complicated utilities with Ksh (Bash would come many years later).

## Symmetry

## Portability and performance

Using tput vs. hard-coding for ANSI and HP terminals.

## Color

ANSI and ANSI256

## Interactivity

The crorplay wrapper.
